# Hi there, I'm Gwen 👋

I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer passionate about building reliable, scalable, and interpretable systems.  
My focus areas are **machine learning**, **MLOps**, and **data quality**, with a strong emphasis on shipping reliable solutions to production, operating in agile, fast-moving environments like AdTech.


🛠 **Currently Building:**  
**Sentinel** — a lightweight platform for monitoring data drift, quality, and model reliability, designed for **low-MLOps environments**.  
(Coming soon — stay tuned!)

💡 **Core Interests:**  
- Machine learning in production
- Data quality and observability
- Scalable and efficient engineering
- Making complex systems simple and robust

🚀 **Skills:**  
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Statistical Modeling, Data Quality Management, MLOps (Docker, Kubernetes, Airflow), Big Data (Spark, Polars), Python, Scala.

🤝 **Let's Connect:**  
I'm always happy to exchange ideas about data, machine learning, and building impactful systems.
